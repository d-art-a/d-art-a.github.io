					"Common Name": "Marri",
					"Significance": "Interesting tree",
					"Note": "This is one of the largest Marri trees on campus, with a height of 20-30m and a diameter of 1.3m. It has been growing on campus since at least 1926, putting it at around 100 years old. Look up and admire the vastness of this mature tree's canopy and observe it's bark as it seems to glow red in the afternoon light.",

					"Common Name": "Jarrah",
					"Significance": "Interesting tree",
					"Note": "The Jarrah is a close cousin to the Marri tree. You can most easily tell them apart by the shape of their gum nuts (Marri are 4x as large) and bark. This stand of Jarrah trees are unique due to their fragmented/tessellated bark, which is more similar to that of Marri trees than Jarrah typically have fibrous, vertical strips. These individuals most likely pre-date the university.",

					"Significance": "Interesting tree",
					"Note": "Located in the Taxonomic Garden, this tree is the largest and oldest of the species on campus, and sports an exceptional example of the genus' characteristic bulbous trunk. It was planted back when the Taxonomic garden was first built back in the 1960s. This species is native to drier rainforest areas in New South Wales and Queensland, and is alien to Western Australia.",

					"Note": "Located around Bilya Marlee (Indigenous Studies building), this family of Marri trees are some of the oldest on campus, and some even pre-date the university. Culturally, these trees are considered a family providing spiritual and physical links to the past. Infact, the building was designed around these trees to keep the family intact. The garden they reside in is called Borne Wirn, meaning 'spirit of the trees'. For more information on this project see https://www.udla.com.au/projects/bilya-marlee-uwa",

					"Note": "Nestled amongst a stand of Marri's in Prescott Court, this eucalypt tree is a little out of place. While endemic to the south-west of Western Australia (Bunbury to Esperance), this is the only Yate on campus. You can identify a Yate by their elongated and pointy operculum (the cap that covers the flower as it develops), which makes the cluster of budding flowers look like a sea anemone.",

					"Common Name": "Lemon-Scented Gum",
					"Significance": "Interesting tree",
					"Note": "Knowledge and availability of local plants was poor in the 1970's, which is why you will find eastern states eucalypts -- like this one -- planted across Perth. This particular tree was planted by landscape architect Lady Jean Brodie-Hall in 1974 when the Psychology building was built. While many eastern state's trees have been replaced with natives across the campus, this one has been kept due to the way it's uniquely twisted trunk forms around and towers over the psychology building. It's a stunning tree to behold.",

The species is native to the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Madeira and western Morocco. When the bark or leaves are cut they secrete a reddish resin known as dragon's blood which has historically been used for artistic and medicinal purposes. There is a larger specimen of this species near Tuart House off Mounts Bay Road",

					"Common Name": "Australian Christmas tree",
					"Significance": "Interesting species",
					"Note": "Known as the Moojar tree to First Nation people, this species is highly spiritual because it is associated with the spirits of the dead who camped out on the branches and flowers of the tree on their way to Kurannup (the land of the ancestors across the Western ocean). Because of this, the tree was never used as shelter or food. Botanically, the species is unique because it is a hemi-parasite, meaning it partially relies on the nutrients it steals from other plants through it's roots. This is why Calothamnus quadrifidus shrubs are planted below (the silver, fluffy-looking plant), as they make great hosts.",

This tree towers above the mathematics courtyard at 30m tall and looks over a huge slab of petrified wood.

					"Note": "Marri trees have histrically been an important resource for First Nation people. The sap has medicinal properties and is useful for tannning kangaroo skins, while the wood was used to create many different tools. The species is also a key to the conservation of native parrots such as Carnabys Cockatoo, which feast on the large 'Honkey Nuts' on their way through Perth.",
