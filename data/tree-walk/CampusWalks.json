Once spanning the entire length of path from Winthrop Hall to Djeran Bidi intersection, the tree lost two massive limbs in November 2018. Stories say that the tree was planted by garden labourer George Munns who dug a big hole, threw in a dead cow and planted the tree back in 1932. Munns was appointed Curator of Grounds in 1955 and retired in 1972 and has a plaque in the Tropical Grove. The tree has a total biomass of 9,190kg, and stores 5,744 kg of carbon.",
